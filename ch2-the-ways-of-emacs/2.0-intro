-Emacs was first a set of macros written by Richard Stallman for a text editor called (TECO) back in 1967

- Ever since then there has been many competing Emacs implementations for Emacs, but today you will likely encounter XEmacs or GNU Emacs

-XEmacs was more advanced than GNU Emacs util GNU Emacs 22, and ever since version 22 GNU had the upper hand

-Eamcs has very odd terminology for the things we have today
