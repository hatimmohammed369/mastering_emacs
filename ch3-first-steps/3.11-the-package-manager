Since version 24, Emacs comes shipped witha package manager that seamlessly displays and install packages from centralized repositories.

There's no one repository you can use for all your needs, there's the official GNU Emacs package repository, ELPA, but its content is rather sparse since you have to physically sign over your rights to the FSF(Free Software Foundation) which most people do not do. But there's also MELPA, a volunteer-run package repository which contains almost all packages in ELPA, the package manager has no problem dealing wih this situation.

Repositories are owned by volunteers and hence they may go down - temporarily or permanently - but you can check them in the Emacs Wiki

The code snippet:
(setq package-archives
'(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")))

add both MELPA and ELPA
you can execute (M-x eval-buffer) to update package manager

Next type (M-x package-list-packages) and Emacs should retrieve the packages from both repos above, MELPA and ELPA

#HINT:
-----
	If you know the name of a package you can call (M-x package-install) and enter the name in the minibuffer, also there's TAB auto-completion
	The package archive(s) change constantly and especially if you leave Emacs running for long periods of time - your local copy becomes stale, but you can call (M-x package-refresh-contents) to refresh the list
