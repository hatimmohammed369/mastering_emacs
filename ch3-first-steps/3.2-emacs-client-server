#EMACS CLEINT SERVER
--------------------
	What if you using the command line but want to edit some file?
Instead of calling emacs, which spawns an entirely new instance, you can use (emacsclient) which initiates a server(you can start several servers) and corresponding to a single instance of Emacs such that all files will edited using the single instance. So several severs, each with its own instance of Emacs, and all files will be edited in that single instance
- Add (server-start) to init.el, or run command: emacs --daemon
- DO NOT use (emacs) binary, use (emacsclient)
Options:
	-c  : creates a graphical frame(if X is available) or a terminal frame
	if X is unavailable
	-nw : creates a terminal frame
	-n  : The client will return immediately instead of waiting for you to finish, usefull if you want to open a bunch of files
	When using the client, pressing CTRL-x # will switch to other buffer you're editing, when all buffers are closed Emacs will signal the client to exit and return control to the terminal
