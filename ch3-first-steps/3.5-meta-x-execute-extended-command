Only a small portion of Emacs commands are bound to key sequences, most are rarely used and hence not worth a separate key binding; or maybe you overriden the default key binding or there was no key binding in the first place or perhaps you forgot the key binding.
When any of the above mentioned senarios happen, you will need to use M-x (mex, M x or meta x). When typing M-x (hold alt then press x) a prompt will appear in the minibuffer asking for the command name to be executed and hit RET (Enter). If you called M-x by mistake you can bail out by C-g
Emacs has a built-in auto-completion support , pressing TAB will open a window containing all possible completions depending on you wrote; if there's only one possible completion it will be completed right away. M-x is not a special command , it's just all other Emacs command , written in elisp and has a key binding which you can change
#Commands and functions#:
------------------------
	When we say (command) it's actually a type of function accessible to the user. For a function to be accessible to a user, it must be (interactive), which is the Emacs term for functions with additional properties and callable from M-x and can be have a key binding. If you're a package author and you want a function accessible to end-users you must mark the function (interactive). Non-interactive function can be called from M-x and can't have key bindings
