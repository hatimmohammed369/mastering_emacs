The Customize interface is divided into groups and subgroups, each group represents one package, mode, or a functionality. The top-level group is called (Emacs) and contains all other groups. To access the Customize interface run (M-x customize)

the Customize interface is made up of two things: faces and options. Options are a catch-all term for things you can Customize that aren't faces. Faces are small panels where you customize a particular property

press buttons (apply) and (apply and save) to make your settings persist, (revert) undo settings. also there's (revert this session's customizations) if you're uphappy with the changes you applied, but keep in mind it only revert the options you in the current buffer - not all the customizations made globally

you can always revert your changes until you save, after that you have to manually undo or use revert button's erase customizations

all customizations are stored in your init file by default (or possibly some other file) and like the rest of emacs the changes are stored as elisp code, making it possibly to manually modify again
