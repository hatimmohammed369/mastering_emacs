Imenu is a generic index framework for jumping to points of interest in a buffer. A major mode author will write an elisp snippest that generates those points of interest.
Most, but not all, major modes support imenu. For programming modes points of interest will be functions, classes, and such things.
Imenu is not bound to any key, use M-x imenu
