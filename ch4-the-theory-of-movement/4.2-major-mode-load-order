When you visit a file, Emacs will pick a major mode. Emacs supports an array of detection mechanisms that can all be changed to suit your needs.
They are listed here in the order they are applied:

1 - FILE-LOCAL VARIABLES are variables that Emacs can enable per-file if they present in te file. They appear as headers or footers in the file, you manually add them to your file contents
  header form:
  -*- mode: mode-name-here; my-variable: value -*-

  footer form:
  Local Variables:
  mode: mode-name-here
  my-variable: value
  End:

Emacs will also look at commented lines using that major mode's comment syntax

It is worth knowing that file variables read into Emacs
are local to that file’s buffer (meaning other buffers are
unaffected by it.) That means if you have particular
settings that apply only to that file, you can add them
to the header or footer and Emacs will load them au-
tomatically. In practical terms, that means everything
from indentation settings to more complex variables
are controllable from file variables.

Because Emacs is in effect running code straight from a
file, all Emacs variables are divided into safe and unsafe
file variables: variables that are declared as safe – typ-
ically by Emacs maintainers – are evaluated automat-
ically. For unsafe variables, you must first tell Emacs
what to do: you can ignore the variable; or evaluate
it once, temporarily, for that file only; or declare it as
safe.

2 - PROGRAM LOADER DIRECTIVES or (shebangs) are also supported. Emacs will figure out the right (if any installed in Emacs) major mode for the file using the available shebang. The variable (interpreter-mode-alist) lists the program loaders that Emacs can detect

3 - MAGIC MODE DETECTION uses the (magic-mode-alist) variable to see if the file begins with a pattern stored in the magic mode variable. This detection applies if you have no way to annotate the file or predict the filename or the extension ahead of time

4 - AUTOMATIC MODE DETECTION is how most major modes are applied. Emacs has a very large registry of patterns that
match a file extension, file name or all or parts of a file's path, stored in the variable (auto-mode-alist).
For instance if you open a zip file, then Emacs enables the major mode archive-mode
Emacs's major mode detection is rather sophisticated and it will almost always pick the right mode for you

6 - CODING SYSTEMS : Emacs has an excellent unicode support
To see the coding system in use for the current buffer, type C-h C <RET>

7 - LINE ENDINGS : When you open a file, Emacs will determine the line endings used.
Line endings and coding systems are displayed in the minibuffer
