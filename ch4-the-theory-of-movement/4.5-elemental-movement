# NAVIGATION KEYS
==================
The usual nagivation keys (up, down, page up, page down, ...) all work normally  Emacs

* NOTICE
---------
The page up/down keys scroll up/down a screenful of text, retaining 2 lines of text for context. The remaining lines count can be adjusted by typing:
M-x customize-option RET next-screen-context-lines

- Terminals and shells that use the (GNU readline library) already use Emacs's nagivation keys commands
