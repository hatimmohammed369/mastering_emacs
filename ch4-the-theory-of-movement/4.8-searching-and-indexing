# ISEARCH : INCREAMENTAL SEARCH
================================
Emacs's increamental search. Use C-s to search forward or C-r to search backwards, also you can change search direction using the same keys respectively. Pressing C-s or C-r again and again will find next match in the respective direction. Hitting Enter selects the current match.
You can customize-option isearch-allow-scroll and isearch-allow-motion so you can move while search because by default motion terminates the search

- C-M-s : Begins a regexp increamental search

* CASE FOLDING
---------------
By default, isearches are not case sensitive. However, when you use one or more uppercase letters in your search, Emacs will automatically switch to a case-sensitive search. It's called (case folding). You can customize that with (M-x customize-option RET case-fold-search RET)
