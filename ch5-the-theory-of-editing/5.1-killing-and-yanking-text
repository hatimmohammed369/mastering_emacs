======================
# KILLING VERSUS YANKING
======================
Deleted text is not retained in your kill ring whereas killed text is

- Consecutive kills append
---------------------------
All kill commands append to the kill ring - that is to say they append
to the text in the kill ring if and only if the last command was also
a kill command. If you break the cycle, by moving or writing or
running a command, the next kill command will create a new entry in
the kill ring.

For instance, typing M-d M-d M-d and then yanking you will get the
last three words you killed together but reversed

- THE KILL RING CAN HOLD MANY ITEMS
------------------------------------

You cannot easily lose information in the kill ring, but nonetheless
the kill ring has a maximum size controlled by (M-x customize-option
RET kill-ring-max RET)

- the kill ring is global shared by all buffers

- Kill is also deleting, because Emacs will rarely put you in
  situations where accidental data loss is likely, this why all
  bounded commands kill instead. The kill ring is finite but it is
  larger than you will ever need

- Marking is unnecessary

- APPENDING TO KILL RING
-------------------------
If you move after a kill you can no longer append with normal kill
commands, you need to use (C-M-w)



================
# KILLING LINES
================
If you want to kill a whole line use C-S-<backspace> but this command
will not work in terminals There is this package
(whole-line-or-region) which modifies C-w such that it kills the whole
current line which has the point, (M-x package-instaal) Also you can
(M-x customize-option RET kill-whole-line) which makes C-k killsthe
newline character


===================
# TRANSPOSING TEXT
===================
When you call a transpose command, Emacs will first look at where the point is and, depending on the exact transpos command you issued, swap two syntactic units surrounding the point
- C-t : Transpose characters
- M-t : Transpose words
- C-M-t : Transpose s-expressions
- C-x C-t : Transpose lines
- M-x transpose-paragraphs
- M-x transpose-sentences

Negative arguments also  work; so do digit arguments, but  not the way
you would  expect. When  you give  a digit argu-  ment to  a transpose
command it will get  the Nth unit ahead of the  point (unless you also
give it  a negative argument, in that  case it is the other way around)
and swap that unit with the one immediately before the point.
